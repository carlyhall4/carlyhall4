Hi, I’m Caroline (Carly) Hall, and this is my Github page. 
I'm interested in computer science languages and data analyst techniques. 
I'm currently working on improving my Python skills, specifically web scraping with Python.
I am looking to collaborate with companies to help them reach their sales goals.
You can reach me at plmkji@gmail.com, or call/text me at (626) 993-8823
