Hi, I’m Caroline (Carly) Hall, and this is my Github page. I'm currently a fourth year student at the University of Miami studying Math, Statistics, Computer Science, and Psychology. I'm interested in problem solving with data analysis techniques. 
I'm currently working on improving my Python skills, specifically website scraping with Python.
I am looking to collaborate with companies to help them reach their sales goals through data mining.
You can reach me at cnh55@miami.edu, or call/text me at (626) 993-8823
