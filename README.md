Hi, I’m Caroline (Carly) Hall, and this is my Github page. I'm a graduate from the University of Miami with a degree in Mathematical Probability and Statistics and minors in Computer Science and Psychology. I'm interested in problem solving with data analysis techniques. 
I'm currently working on improving my SQL skills, specifically the use of more advanced queries.
I am looking to collaborate with companies to help them reach their goals through data analysis.
You can reach me at carhall8900@gmail.com, or call/text me at (626) 993-8823.
